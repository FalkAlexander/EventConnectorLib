        Sends an event by placing it into the outgoing events queue.

        This method takes an `Event` object and adds it to the queue of outgoing events to be processed

            *args (Any): Additional positional arguments to pass to the callback function.
            **kwargs (Any): Additional keyword arguments to pass to the callback function.

        The `response_callback` can be used to handle the response event as it is received.
        This mechanism is similar to a signal/slot or callback system, allowing you to define a
